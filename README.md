# Library Seat Reservation System

> **Layer 2** of an AI-powered meta-software development pipeline (DTS114TC CW).
> The Notebook in `../Task1/DTS114_CW_Task1.ipynb` is **Layer 1** — it generates everything in this directory.

A Flask + SQLite seat-booking system for a university library. Eleven business rules, JWT-style auth via `itsdangerous`, single-page vanilla-JS frontend, container-ready, two-stage GitHub Actions CI.

## Quick start (local Python)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# open http://localhost:5000
```

## Quick start (Docker — recommended)

```bash
docker build -t library-seat-reservation .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name lsr library-seat-reservation
# open http://localhost:5000
```

To stop:
```bash
docker stop lsr && docker rm lsr
```

## Conda environment (matches the lab `ai_in_se_cw`)

```bash
conda env create -f ai_in_se_cw.yml
conda activate ai_in_se_cw
python app.py
```

## Default seeded users

| Username  | Password   | Role  |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| `admin`   | `admin123` | admin |
| `student1`| `student123` | user |

The database (`library.db`) is created on first run if missing, with a few sample seats (single + meeting rooms).

### Unified error format

All non-2xx responses return:

```json
{ "error": "human readable", "code": "AUTH_001", "details": [...] }
```

Codes: `AUTH_001` (401), `PERM_001` (403), `PARAM_001` (400), `BUS_001` (409), `RES_001` (404), `SYS_001` (500).

---

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing
```

15 AI-generated cases covering FR-01..FR-11, all four error code groups, and unified error format. Coverage report can also be exported with `--cov-report=html`.

---

## CI/CD pipeline

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` (extends the Week 6 lab pattern):

| Job | Steps | Failure behaviour |
|-----|-------|-------------------|
| `test` | flake8 (E9/F-class only) → pytest with coverage | block stage 2 |
| `build` | `needs: test` → `docker build` → tag verify | only runs when `test` is green |

Artefacts: coverage XML uploaded on every run.

---

## Deployment

Two-target split, mirroring the Week 6 Practical:

| Target | What is deployed | Reason |
|--------|------------------|--------|
| **GitHub Pages** | static landing snapshot of the SPA | matches Practical 3 (Pages) workflow |
| **Hugging Face Spaces** (Docker SDK, free tier) | Flask backend (this entire directory, via `Dockerfile`) | Pages cannot host Python backends; HF chosen over Render because it does not require payment-card verification |

Hugging Face Spaces auto-deploys on push to its remote (`huggingface` branch `main`). Production overrides:

| Env var | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | replace dev default for token signing |
| `FLASK_HOST` / `FLASK_PORT` | bind config (defaults `0.0.0.0:5000`) |
| `TOKEN_MAX_AGE` | token validity in seconds (default `43200` = 12h) |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | seed admin account |

Limitations: SQLite resets on container restart; production migration would move to PostgreSQL.

## Reproducibility

Re-running `../Task1/DTS114_CW_Task1.ipynb` (Restart & Run All) regenerates this directory from scratch. AI-generation audit logs are at `docs/image_generation_audit.json` and `docs/test_generation_audit.json`.

---

## Methodology

**Hybrid AI-DLC** — AI is the first-pass author, the human is the loss function. The notebook applies an audit gate at every SDLC phase (requirements → design → implementation → verification). See `../Report.pdf` for the full reflective report.
